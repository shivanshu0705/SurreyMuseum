                <h2>Community Treasures</h2>
                <p>Community Treasures exhibits are an opportunity for community groups, individuals, and cultural
                    organizations from Surrey to showcase their treasures and share their stories with a wider
                    audience.
                    These exhibits are temporary, and submission based. They serve to increase access to Surrey’s
                    diverse stories and experiences. Visitors get to view items that would normally be unavailable to
                    see elsewhere in the community.</p>

                <h2>Heritage Campus</h2>
                <p>In recent years, both Museum of Surrey and the Cloverdale Library have been renovated and expanded.
                    The iconic 1881 Town Hall and Anniedale School were also relocated to the campus, where they
                    underwent restorations to be used once again. You can also enjoy the virtual tour of Heritage Campus
                    by getting the tickets from the ticket counter</p>

                <h2>Photo Mural Project</h2>
                <p>Displayed on the wall along the staircase, the 46 feet by 15 feet mural showcases Surrey and its many
                    faces. A true community collaboration, the mural features over 2,000 photos submitted by members of
                    the public. Historic Surrey photos are also included.
                    From far away, the mural looks like a river which leads to the new Indigenous Hall. The
                    river theme reflects the 1400 kilometres of rivers and streams from Surrey’s geography.
